This is a collection of websites I've made with the help of truly inspirational coders!

Project descriptions:
1. B on W filter - Tribute to Kobe "Black Mamba" Bryant which has a hover effect on both images
  Can you balance them?
2. Blender loader - Color wheel behind has a blur effect and rotation.
3. Liquid loader - Wave illusion makes it appear as if the box is filling up. It's basically a lopsided circle that rotates while float up!
4. Pulse effect - Can be seen as location beacon or as a breathing guide.
5. Rocket - Dedicated to the first commercial launch of SpaceX. I'm a huge Elon Musk admirer!
6. Sign in form - Smooth transition effect on overlays make the process look effortless.
7. Smooooth - A snappy yet smooth scrolling experience!
8. Tube light - A customizable neon sign just for you!
9. Typewriter Effect - I've always wanted to know how to do this, thank you Brad!
